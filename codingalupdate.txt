Hello, This is Shuaib, I am a student in grade VI and I am learning how to do 2D and 3D animation and 
coding I love drawing which is why I like animation because it feels like your
picture moving on its own.

some of my favourite games are forsaken , outcome memories and die of death
some of my closest freinds
